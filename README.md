# Product_Dashboard_PowerBI

With the Product dataset, I wanted to see how much stock we had (Sum and the total Value)

With the dashboard, we are able to see available stock, backordered stock, discontinued stock, limited stock, pre-orders and out of stock. 

We are also able to see the value of stock by category and Brand.



Oh and I used DAX to get the sum of the stock and the total value of the stock.
